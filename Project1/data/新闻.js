    "details": "The higher income levels in London are concentrated in the central and western urban centres, with income levels decreasing from the city centre to the surrounding suburbs. The unemployment rate in London rose rapidly from 2008 and remained high for several years, recovering to the same level as before the subprime crisis in 2015 but resuming its upward trend due to the global epidemic in 2020.  The level of disposable income, on the other hand, shows an opposite trend to the change in the unemployment rate.  The whole of London is dominated by the tertiary sector, with the boroughs in the centre of the city dominated by high technology industries such as finance and technology, and the surrounding areas dominated by health and retail industries that are oriented towards the daily lives of residents. The number of people employed in the three main sectors of technology, transport and storage, and education has been increasing since 2000, showing a gradual expansion from the financial sector to the technology sector in London."
